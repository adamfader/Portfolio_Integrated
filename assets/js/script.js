The languages used to create this game were HTML5, CSS3 & JavaScript. Event listeners in the JavaScript code were the key to making the videos and game function so well together. They allow for the timimg of the user's inputs to be unpredictable without the overlapping of videos. I hope that you enjoy playing this game as much as I enjoyed programming it.",

Every time a character attacks, their health increases by its base number. The strategy of this game is to initially attack opponents that have the lowest counterattack. This allows you to build up your attack power before attacking the stronger opponents. The languages used to create this game were HTML5, CSS3, jQuery & JavaScript. The movement of characters was done by adding and removing CSS3 classes via jQuery while certain conditions exist. The jQuery animate capability was used to display the character's calculated health in the lightsaber health meter.",

Simultaneously, the latitude and longitude returned by Google Places is sent to the Weather Underground API, which returns the current weather for that location.
